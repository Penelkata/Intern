Task Breakdown

- Break into smaller problems
- Hardcode in the begining and switch to user input after 
- Attempt to regularly commit to Github

Subtask 1:
1. Graphically represent the flights, each city is a node and each flight is an edge
2. Implement the appropriate search algorithm - Breadth-First
3. Return the travel time(1 hour for each flight) or 0 if unreachable

Subtask 2:
- Test Cases for Subtask 1 function. // TO DO

Subtask 3:
1. Graphically represent considering passenger capacities // TO DO
2. Identify appropriate search algorithm
3. Return the quickest time(considering the group can travel) or 0 if unreachable // TO DO
4. Test Cases for the subtask
